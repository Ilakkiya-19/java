Problem Statement â€“ An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.
Example :

Input :
200  -> Value of V
540   -> Value of W

Output :
TW =130 FW=70

Explanation:
130+70 = 200 vehicles
(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels



CODE:


import java.util.*;
public class j2
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter v:");
        int v=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("enter W:");
        int w=sc.nextInt();
        int TW = (4 * v - w) / 2;
        int FW = v- TW;
        System.out.println("Twowheelers = " + TW + " Fourwheelers = " + FW);
    }
}

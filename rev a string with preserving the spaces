logic:

new StringBuilder(input):

This creates a new StringBuilder object initialized with the input string.
StringBuilder is a class in Java that provides a mutable sequence of characters. Unlike String, which is immutable, StringBuilder allows you to modify the sequence without creating new objects.
.reverse():

This method is called on the StringBuilder instance.
The reverse() method reverses the sequence of characters in the StringBuilder object.
It modifies the StringBuilder instance in place, so after this method is called, the characters are in reverse order compared to their original sequence.
.toString():

This method converts the StringBuilder object back to a String.
After reversing the characters, you use toString() to obtain a String representation of the reversed sequence.
Summary
Initialization: new StringBuilder(input) creates a StringBuilder object with the contents of the input string.
Reversal: .reverse() reverses the characters in the StringBuilder.
Conversion: .toString() converts the reversed StringBuilder back to a String.
